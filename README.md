# ABC-Analysis-of-Inventory
This Python code loads stock data from an Excel file and performs an ABC analysis.
It calculates the total value, sorts items by this value, computes cumulative sums and percentages, and assigns ABC categories based on these percentages.
The processed data is then displayed and optionally visualised using a bar chart with Plotly.
